# Time Intervals

Time intervals are used throughout OpenNEM to aggregate time series data into fixed-width periods. This functionality is used in both the API and internal data processing.

## Available Intervals

The following intervals are supported:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5m | 5-minute trading interval (default) |
| 1h | 1-hour interval |
| 1d | Daily interval |
| 7d | 7-day interval |
| 1M | Monthly interval |
| 3M | Quarterly interval |
| season | Seasonal interval (Australian meteorological seasons) |
| 1y | Yearly interval |
| fy | Financial year (July-June) |

## Usage in API Requests

Intervals can be specified in API requests using the `interval` parameter:

```
GET /v1/stats/power?interval=1h
```

The interval parameter accepts any of the values listed above. If not specified, the API defaults to using 5-minute intervals (`5m`).

## Special Cases

### Seasons

Seasons are based on Australian meteorological seasons:

- Summer: December - February
- Autumn: March - May
- Winter: June - August
- Spring: September - November

### Financial Year

The financial year interval aggregates data from July 1st to June 30th of the following year. For example, FY2023 covers July 1st 2022 to June 30th 2023.

## Implementation Details

The interval functionality is implemented consistently across our databases:

### TimescaleDB

Uses the `time_bucket()` function for simple intervals and `time_bucket_ng()` for more complex cases like seasons and financial years.

### ClickHouse

Uses native ClickHouse time functions like `toStartOfHour()` with custom implementations for seasons and financial years.
