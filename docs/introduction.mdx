## API Platform

<Note>The OpenElectricity Platform and client libraries are current in beta and still under active development.</Note>

* OpenElectricity Platform for API key management is at [platform.openelectricity.org.au](https://platform.openelectricity.org.au)
* Python client library is at [github.com/opennem/openelectricity-python](https://github.com/opennem/openelectricity-python)
* TypeScript client library is at [github.com/opennem/openelectricity-typescript](https://github.com/opennem/openelectricity-typescript)

## Project Overview

The OpenNEM project ([GitHub organization `opennem`](https://github.com/opennem/)) consists of three primary projects in separate source code repositories:

 * `opennem` - [GitHub](https://github.com/opennem/opennem)  - GitHub project name `opennem`. The primary backend stack that crawls all the data sources, parses them, generates outputs, the database schema and the API interface for integrations. The primary development language is Python.
 * `openelectricity` - [GitHub](https://github.com/opennem/openelectricity) - The OpenElectricity website.
 * `opennem-fe` - [GitHub](https://github.com/opennem/opennem-fe) - This is the web frontend for the OpenElectricity [data tracker website](https://explorer.openelectricity.org.au)

## Supported Data Sets

Currently supported electricity networks and data sources:

* `NEM` - [Australia National Electricity Market](https://www.nemweb.com.au/) - energy network data for Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory
* `WEM` - [Australia Western Electricity Market](http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/) - energy network data for Western Australia
* `APVI` - [APVI](https://apvi.org.au) - Rooftop solar data for Australia
* `BoM` - [Bureau of Meteorology](https://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/) - weather data for Australia
