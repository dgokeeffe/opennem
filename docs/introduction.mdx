<Note>OpenElectricity is currently in the process of being renamed from OpenNEM. There are still some repostories and projects yet to be renamed</Note>

OpenElectricity is a platform for tracking and visualizing electricity data from across Australia.

The OpenElectricity project aims to make energy network data accessible to a wider audience of users and developersthrough a website portal and data access API's and tools.

## Project Overview

The OpenNEM project ([GitHub organization `opennem`](https://github.com/opennem/)) consists of three primary projects in separate source code repositories:

 * `opennem` - [GitHub](https://github.com/opennem/opennem)  - GitHub project name `opennem`. The primary backend stack that crawls all the data sources, parses them, generates outputs, the database schema and the API interface for integrations. The primary development language is Python.
 * `openelectricity` - [GitHub](https://github.com/opennem/openelectricity) - The OpenElectricity website.
 * `opennem-fe` - [GitHub](https://github.com/opennem/opennem-fe) - This is the web frontend for the OpenElectricity [data tracker website](https://explorer.openelectricity.org.au)
 * `openelectricity-py` - [GitHub](https://github.com/opennem/openelectricity-py) - GitHUB project name `openelectricity-py`. This is the Python client library for accessing OpenElectricity data via the API. It also contains a set of tools for dealing with energy data.


## Supported Data Sets

Currently supported electricity networks and data sources:

* `NEM` - [Australia National Electricity Market](https://www.nemweb.com.au/) - energy network data for Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory
* `WEM` - [Australia Western Electricity Market](http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/) - energy network data for Western Australia
* `APVI` - [APVI](https://apvi.org.au) - Rooftop solar data for Australia
* `BoM` - [Bureau of Meteorology](https://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/) - weather data for Australia
