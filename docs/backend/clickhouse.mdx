# ClickHouse Integration

OpenNEM uses ClickHouse for efficient storage and querying of time series data. This document describes the ClickHouse integration, table schemas, and usage patterns.

## Configuration

ClickHouse connection is configured through environment variables:

```bash
CLICKHOUSE_URL=clickhouse://user:pass@host:port/database
```

The default URL is `clickhouse://localhost:9000/opennem` if not specified.

## Tables

### Market Summary

The market summary table stores aggregated market data including price, demand, and energy calculations.

```sql
CREATE TABLE market_summary (
    interval DateTime64(3),
    network_id String,
    network_region String,
    price Nullable(Float64),
    demand Nullable(Float64),
    demand_total Nullable(Float64),
    demand_energy Nullable(Float64),
    demand_total_energy Nullable(Float64)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY (interval, network_id, network_region)
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(interval)
```

#### Materialized Views

Two materialized views provide pre-aggregated data for common queries:

1. `market_summary_daily_mv`: Daily aggregations including average/min/max values and energy sums
2. `market_summary_monthly_mv`: Monthly aggregations including average/min/max values and energy sums

## Usage

### Energy Calculation

Energy values are calculated from demand readings using the average between current and previous intervals:

```python
demand_energy = (current_demand + previous_demand) / 2 / intervals_per_hour
```

### Data Processing

Data is processed in two ways:

1. Real-time processing of new intervals
2. Backlog processing for historical data

The system handles both single interval updates and bulk historical data loading efficiently.

## Query Examples

### Daily Aggregations

```sql
SELECT
    date,
    network_id,
    network_region,
    price_avg,
    demand_avg,
    demand_energy_sum,
    demand_total_energy_sum
FROM market_summary_daily_mv
WHERE date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
```

### Monthly Aggregations

```sql
SELECT
    month,
    network_id,
    network_region,
    price_avg,
    demand_avg,
    demand_energy_sum,
    demand_total_energy_sum
FROM market_summary_monthly_mv
WHERE month BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
```

## Performance Considerations

- Data is partitioned by month for efficient historical queries
- The table uses the MergeTree engine for high insert and query performance
- Materialized views maintain pre-aggregated data for common query patterns
- Batch processing is used for historical data loading
