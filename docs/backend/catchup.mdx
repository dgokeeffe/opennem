# Data Catchup Process

The OpenNEM platform includes an automated catchup process that monitors for gaps in facility data and triggers appropriate data collection and processing tasks when gaps are detected.

## Overview

The catchup process is designed to:

1. Monitor the last seen timestamps for operating NEM generator facilities
2. Detect gaps in data collection using Brisbane timezone
3. Trigger immediate and historical data crawlers as needed
4. Update facility data ranges and aggregates
5. Process energy calculations for the gap period
6. Alert operators via Slack when gaps are detected

## How It Works

### Gap Detection

The system checks for gaps by:

1. Querying the most recent `data_last_seen` timestamp from operating NEM generator units
2. Comparing this timestamp against the current time (in Australia/Brisbane timezone)
3. Flagging a gap if the difference exceeds a configurable threshold (default 30 minutes)
4. Calculating the exact gap duration for processing and reporting

### Catchup Process

When a gap is detected, the following actions are taken in sequence:

1. **Immediate Data Collection**
   - Runs current data crawlers:
     - AEMO NEM Dispatch SCADA
     - AEMO NEM Dispatch IS
     - AEMO NEM Trading IS
     - AEMO NEM Rooftop
     - AEMO NEM Rooftop Forecast
     - APVI Rooftop Today

2. **Historical Data Collection**
   - For gaps longer than 3 hours, runs additional historical crawlers:
     - AEMO NEM Dispatch Actual GEN
     - AEMO NEM Next Day Dispatch

3. **WEM Data Collection**
   - Runs WEM crawlers for the last 7 days
   - Ensures WEM data is synchronized with NEM data

4. **Data Processing**
   - Updates facility seen ranges
   - Processes energy calculations for the gap period
   - Updates facility aggregates for the affected intervals
   - Number of intervals processed is calculated based on the gap duration (5-minute intervals)

5. **Alerting**
   - Sends Slack notifications to operators when gaps are detected
   - Includes environment, last seen timestamp, current time, and gap duration
   - Uses the monitoring webhook for alerts

## Configuration

The catchup process can be configured through the following parameters:

- `max_gap_minutes`: Maximum allowable gap in minutes before triggering catchup (default: 30)
- Slack webhook URLs and user tags are configured via environment variables
- All timestamps are handled in Australia/Brisbane timezone

## Usage

The catchup process is typically run as a scheduled task in the ARQ task queue. It can also be run manually for testing:

```python
from opennem.workers.catchup import run_catchup_check

# Run with default settings (30 minute threshold)
await run_catchup_check()

# Run with custom gap threshold
await run_catchup_check(max_gap_minutes=15)
```

## Monitoring

The catchup process logs its activities using the standard OpenNEM logging system. Key events that are logged include:

- Gap detections with precise timestamps and durations
- Crawler execution status for each crawler type
- Error conditions with detailed error messages
- Processing completions including number of intervals processed
- Debug logs showing exact timestamps for gap calculations

Logs can be monitored through the standard logging infrastructure and the Slack alerts provide immediate notification of significant gaps.
