# Data Gap Tracking

The OpenNEM system includes functionality to track data gaps in facility data. This helps prevent multiple catchup processes from running simultaneously and provides a history of data gap incidents.

## Overview

When a data gap is detected (defined as no new data being received for a configurable period), the system:

1. Creates a new data gap incident record in Redis
2. Runs the catchup process to attempt to fill the gap
3. Marks the incident as resolved once data flow resumes
4. Archives the incident for historical tracking

## Implementation

The data gap tracking system uses Redis to store both active and historical incidents. Each incident contains:

- Start time: When the gap was first detected
- Last seen time: The last time data was seen before the gap
- Resolution status: Whether the gap has been resolved
- Resolution time: When the gap was resolved (if applicable)

### Redis Keys

The system uses the following Redis key patterns:

- `opennem:datagap:active`: The currently active incident (if any)
- `opennem:datagap:archive:<timestamp>`: Historical archived incidents

### Preventing Duplicate Catchups

Before starting a new catchup process, the system checks for any active incidents. If an incident is already being handled, the new catchup process is skipped to prevent duplicate work.

## Configuration

The data gap detection threshold is configured via the `max_gap_minutes` parameter in the `run_catchup_check` function. By default, this is set to 30 minutes.

## Monitoring

Data gap incidents are logged and notifications are sent via Slack when:

- A new data gap is detected
- A data gap is resolved

The notifications include:
- The environment (e.g. PROD, DEV)
- Last seen timestamp
- Current time
- Gap duration

## Code Example

Here's an example of how the system handles a data gap:

```python
# Check for data gaps
has_gap, last_seen = await check_facility_data_gaps(max_gap_minutes=30)

if has_gap:
    # Create incident record
    await create_incident(start_time=datetime.now(), last_seen=last_seen)

    # Run catchup processes...

    # Check if resolved
    has_gap, _ = await check_facility_data_gaps(max_gap_minutes=30)
    if not has_gap:
        await resolve_incident(resolution_time=datetime.now())
```
