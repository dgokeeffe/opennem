## Overview

OpenElectricity integrates weather data from Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) stations and tracks environmental metrics for generation facilities.

## Weather Stations

### Station Data

Stored in `bom_station`:
- Station code and name
- Geographic location
- Altitude
- State jurisdiction
- Priority level

### Observations

Stored in `bom_observation`:
- Temperature (apparent and air)
- Wind speed and direction
- Pressure
- Humidity
- Cloud cover

## Data Collection

### Weather Metrics

Observations include:
- `temp_air`: Air temperature
- `temp_apparent`: Feels-like temperature
- `wind_spd`: Wind speed
- `wind_dir`: Wind direction
- `press_qnh`: Pressure
- `humidity`: Relative humidity

### Collection Intervals

- Regular interval observations
- Quality controlled measurements
- Station-specific collection frequencies

## Environmental Impact

### Emissions Tracking

Tracked in `at_facility_intervals`:
- `emissions`: CO2 equivalent emissions
- `emissions_intensity`: Emissions per MWh
- Facility-specific factors
- Regional emissions intensity

## Data Access

### API Endpoints

```
GET /v4/stats/emissionfactor/network/{network_code} - Get emission factors
GET /v4/stats/emissionfactor/network/{network_code}/{network_region_code} - Get regional factors
```

## Best Practices

1. Verify weather station proximity to facilities
2. Check observation quality flags
3. Consider seasonal variations
4. Account for missing data
5. Validate emissions calculations
