# Facilities and Generation Data

## Overview

The OpenElectricity platform tracks electricity generation facilities across Australia's electricity markets. This guide explains how facility data is structured, accessed, and interpreted.

## Facility Structure

Each facility in the system is represented by several interconnected data structures:

### Core Facility Data
- Unique facility code
- Facility name and description
- Network location (NEM/WEM)
- Network region (e.g., NSW1, VIC1)
- Operational status
- Wikipedia references and external links

### Generation Units
Units within facilities are tracked with:
- Unit codes and numbers
- Registered capacity
- Fuel technology type
- Emissions factors
- Registration and deregistration dates
- Expected closure dates

## Fuel Technologies

Facilities are categorized by fuel technology types:

### Renewable Technologies
- Solar (utility and rooftop)
- Wind
- Hydro
- Battery storage (charging/discharging)
- Bioenergy (biomass, biogas)

### Non-Renewable Technologies
- Coal (black and brown)
- Gas (OCGT, CCGT)
- Distillate
- Liquid fuel

## Data Collection

Generation data is collected at regular intervals:

### Facility SCADA Data
- 5-minute intervals for NEM
- 30-minute intervals for WEM
- Includes generated output and energy
- Quality flags for data validation

### Historical Storage
Data is stored in the following tables:
- `facility_scada`: Raw generation data
- `at_facility_intervals`: Processed interval data
- `facilities`: Core facility information
- `units`: Individual generation unit details

## Accessing Facility Data

### API Endpoints
The API provides several endpoints for accessing facility data:

```
GET /v4/facility/ - List all facilities
GET /v4/facility/au/{network_id}/{station_code} - Get specific facility
```

### Query Parameters
- `network_id`: Filter by network (NEM/WEM)
- `network_region`: Filter by region
- `fueltech`: Filter by fuel technology
- `status`: Filter by operational status

## Data Analysis

### Generation Analysis
Track facility performance through:
- Real-time generation levels
- Historical generation patterns
- Capacity factors
- Emissions intensity

### Aggregation Options
Data can be aggregated by:
- Facility
- Region
- Fuel technology
- Time period

## Status Tracking

Facilities are tracked through various operational states:

### Status Types
- Operating: Currently generating
- Commissioning: Being tested
- Announced: Planned facility
- Mothballed: Temporarily closed
- Retired: Permanently closed

### Status Updates
- Status changes are tracked historically
- Includes dates of status changes
- Maintains audit trail of facility lifecycle

## Emissions Tracking

### Emissions Data
- CO2 emissions factors per facility
- Total emissions calculations
- Emissions intensity tracking
- Source references for emissions factors

### Environmental Impact
Track environmental performance through:
- Carbon intensity metrics
- Renewable vs non-renewable generation
- Emissions reduction tracking

## Best Practices

When working with facility data:

1. Always verify facility codes against the master list
2. Check data quality flags for SCADA readings
3. Consider timezone differences between regions
4. Account for facility status changes in analysis
5. Validate emissions calculations against source data

## Data Quality

### Quality Assurance
- SCADA data quality flags
- Data validation processes
- Missing data handling
- Anomaly detection

### Data Corrections
- Historical data corrections
- SCADA calibration adjustments
- Manual data verification processes

## Future Developments

The facility tracking system is continuously evolving:

### Planned Enhancements
- Enhanced emissions tracking
- Improved facility metadata
- Better status change tracking
- Advanced aggregation capabilities

### Integration Opportunities
- Weather data correlation
- Market price integration
- Network constraint mapping
- Demand response tracking
