# Overview

The OpenNEM system uses a hierarchical classification system for different types of electricity generation technologies:

1. **Fueltechs** - Individual generation technologies (e.g., Coal Black, Solar Utility, Wind)
2. **Fueltech Groups** - Broader categories that group similar technologies (e.g., Coal, Solar, Wind)

This classification system is used throughout the OpenNEM API and visualisations to provide consistent grouping and coloring of generation types.

# Fueltech Groups

Fueltech groups are the high-level categories used to group similar generation technologies. Each group has a distinct color used in visualisations.

| Group Code           | Label                | Renewable |
|---------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| coal                | Coal                 | FALSE     |
| gas                 | Gas                  | FALSE     |
| wind                | Wind                 | TRUE      |
| solar               | Solar                | TRUE      |
| battery_charging    | Battery (Charging)   | FALSE     |
| battery_discharging | Battery (Discharging)| FALSE     |
| hydro               | Hydro                | TRUE      |

| pumps               | Pumps               | FALSE     |

# Fueltechs

Fueltechs represent specific generation technologies. Each fueltech belongs to a fueltech group and inherits properties like color from its group.

# Special Categories

Some fueltechs don't belong to a specific fueltech group as they represent special cases:

- **Aggregators** - Virtual Power Plants (VPP) and Demand Response (DR) units that combine multiple smaller generators
- **Network** - Imports, exports and interconnector flows between regions
- **Battery** - Generic battery category (distinct from charging/discharging)
- **Nuclear** - Currently not used in Australia but maintained for international compatibility

# Technical Implementation

The fueltechs are defined in [opennem/db/fixtures/fueltechs.json](https://github.com/opennem/opennem/blob/master/opennem/db/fixtures/fueltechs.json) and fueltech groups in [opennem/db/fixtures/fueltech_groups.json](https://github.com/opennem/opennem/blob/master/opennem/db/fixtures/fueltech_groups.json).

The fueltech schema is defined in `pydantic` as:

```python
class FueltechSchema(BaseConfig):
    code: str
    label: str
    renewable: bool = False
```
