## Overview of the NEM Spot Market
The National Electricity Market (NEM) operates as a centralized exchange where the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) matches electricity supply and demand in real time.

- **Bidding and Dispatch**: Generators submit bids indicating the price at which they are willing to supply electricity. AEMO stacks these bids from least to most expensive and dispatches the least-cost mix of generators required to meet demand.
- **Five-Minute Settlement**: Since October 2021, the NEM settles on a five-minute basis. Generators receive the spot price for their electricity based on each five-minute interval.

## NEM Price Caps and Floors
To manage market volatility and ensure reliability, the NEM enforces the following price limits:

- **Price Cap (Maximum)**: $15,500 per MWh
- **Price Floor (Minimum)**: -$1,000 per MWh

These limits define the maximum and minimum spot prices that can occur during any five-minute interval.

## Market Value Calculation in OpenElectricity

OpenElectricity calculates the market value of electricity generation using the following methodology:

1. For each generator and interval, the value is determined by multiplying the electricity generated by the spot price in the generator's network region.
2. The total market value for a period is the sum of these values across all intervals and generators.

### Formula
Let:
- `g[i, j]` = Electricity generated by generator `i` in interval `j` (in MWh)
- `p[j]` = Spot price in the network region for interval `j` (in $/MWh)
- `N` = Total number of generators
- `M` = Total number of intervals

The total market value (`V`) is calculated as:

<latex>
V = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{M} g[i, j] \times p[j]
</latex>

### Explanation

- The formula aggregates the contribution of each generator during every interval.
- By summing across all generators and intervals, the total market value reflects the overall economic activity within the NEM.
