# Networks and Regions

## Overview

OpenElectricity tracks data across multiple Australian electricity networks. Each network has distinct characteristics, regions, and operational parameters.

## Network Structure

### Primary Networks

- **National Electricity Market (`NEM`)**:
  - 5-minute intervals
  - Timezone: Australia/Sydney
  - Regions: `NSW1`, `QLD1`, `SA1`, `TAS1`, `VIC1`
  - Data since: 1998-12-06

- **Wholesale Electricity Market (`WEM`)**:
  - 30-minute intervals
  - Timezone: Australia/Perth
  - Single region covering Western Australia
  - Data since: 2006-09-19

## Network Regions

### NEM Regions

Each region represents a state-based jurisdiction:

- `NSW1`: New South Wales
- `QLD1`: Queensland
- `SA1`: South Australia
- `TAS1`: Tasmania
- `VIC1`: Victoria
- `SNOWY1`: Snowy Mountains region

### Region Properties

Each region contains:
- Unique timezone settings
- Price nodes
- Interconnector definitions
- Generation facilities
- Demand data

## Data Collection

### Interval Data
Networks collect data at different intervals:

- `NEM`:
  - Dispatch: 5-minute intervals
  - Settlement: 30-minute intervals
  - Price: 5-minute intervals

- `WEM`:
  - Dispatch: 30-minute intervals
  - Settlement: 30-minute intervals
  - Price: 30-minute intervals

### Data Types

For each network region:
- Generation by facility
- Regional demand
- Interconnector flows
- Price information
- Emissions data

## Network Flows

### Interconnectors

Interconnectors link different regions:

- `NSW1-QLD1`: Queensland to NSW
- `VIC1-NSW1`: Victoria to NSW
- `VIC1-SA1`: Victoria to South Australia
- `VIC1-TAS1`: Victoria to Tasmania (Basslink)

### Flow Data
Tracked in `at_network_flows`:
- Energy imports/exports
- Emissions transfers
- Market value transfers
- Flow constraints

## Network Demand

### Demand Components

Regional demand includes:
- Operational demand
- Behind-the-meter generation
- Large industrial loads
- Network losses

### Demand Data Storage

Stored in `at_network_demand`:
- Trading interval demand
- Energy volumes
- Market values
- Regional aggregations

## Price Mechanisms

### Price Formation

Each network has distinct price formation:

- `NEM`:
  - 5-minute dispatch price
  - Regional reference price
  - Market price caps/floors

- `WEM`:
  - 30-minute balancing price
  - Capacity mechanism
  - Ancillary services

## Network Time Handling

### Timezone Management

Networks operate in different timezones:
- `NEM`: AEST/AEDT (UTC+10/11)
- `WEM`: AWST (UTC+8)

### Interval Alignment

- Start times aligned to network intervals
- Daylight savings time handling
- Historical time adjustments

## Data Access

### API Endpoints

Network data is accessible via:

```
GET /v4/networks - List all networks
GET /v4/networks/regions - Get network regions
GET /v4/stats/flow/network/{network_code} - Get network flows
```

### Query Parameters

Common parameters:
- `network_id`: Network identifier
- `network_region`: Region code
- `interval`: Data interval
- `period`: Time period

## Data Quality

### Quality Flags

Data quality is tracked through:
- SCADA quality flags
- Settlement revision numbers
- Data source identifiers
- Validation status

### Historical Data

Historical data considerations:
- Market start dates
- Rule change implementations
- System upgrades
- Data corrections

## Best Practices

When working with network data:

1. Always specify network and region codes explicitly
2. Handle timezone conversions carefully
3. Consider interval boundaries
4. Check data quality flags
5. Account for market events

## Network Rules

### Operating Procedures

Networks operate under different rules:

- `NEM`:
  - National Electricity Rules
  - AEMO procedures
  - Regional requirements

- `WEM`:
  - Wholesale Market Rules
  - System Management procedures
  - Technical requirements

### Compliance Requirements

Data handling must comply with:
- Market rules
- Privacy requirements
- Data retention policies
- Quality standards
