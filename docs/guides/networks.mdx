## Overview

OpenElectricity tracks data across multiple Australian electricity networks. Each network has distinct characteristics, regions, and operational parameters.

OpenElectricity currently supports the `NEM` and `WEM` as primary networks, which covers the majority of the Australian electricity market outside of the Northern Territory and North-West Australia.

OpenElectricity also supports the `AEMO_ROOFTOP` and `APVI` as secondary networks, which covers the rooftop solar market in Australia.

## National Electricity Market (NEM)

The National Electricity Market (NEM) is Australia's primary electricity system, spanning approximately 5,000 kilometers from Port Douglas, Queensland, to Port Lincoln, South Australia. It supplies around 80% of Australia's electricity consumption, generating approximately 200 terawatt hours annually.

The NEM transports electricity via high-voltage transmission lines from generators to distributors, who deliver it to homes and businesses.

While the NEM covers much of the country, Western Australia and the Northern Territory operate independent electricity systems with separate regulatory frameworks.

## Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM)

The Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) is the electricity market for the state of Western Australia. It is an isolated network, with no interconnections.

## Network Structure

### Primary Networks

- **National Electricity Market (`NEM`)**:
  - 5-minute intervals for generation, price and demand for each region
  - Timezone: `UTC+10`
  - Regions: `NSW1`, `QLD1`, `SA1`, `TAS1`, `VIC1`
  - Data since: `1998-12-06`

- **Wholesale Electricity Market (`WEM`)**:
  - 5-minute intervals for generation, price and demand (since October 2023)
  - Timezone: `UTC+8`
  - Single region covering Western Australia
  - Data since: `2006-09-19`

### Secondary Networks

- **AEMO Rooftop Solar (`AEMO_ROOFTOP`)**:
  - 30-minute intervals
  - Timezone: `UTC+10`
  - Regions: Every Australian state
  - Data since: `2018-03-01`

- **Australian Power System Virtual Interconnection (`APVI`)**:
  - 15-minute intervals
  - Timezone: `UTC+10`
  - Regions: Every Australian state
  - Data since: `2015-03-19`

## Network Regions

Networks are split into regions, which for the NEM represent each state a generation facility is located in.

Network regions have their own market pricing and demand data, as well as interconnector flows and generation facilities.

### NEM Regions

Each region represents a state-based jurisdiction:

- `NSW1`: New South Wales (including the ACT)
- `QLD1`: Queensland
- `SA1`: South Australia
- `TAS1`: Tasmania (since `2005-05-16`)
- `VIC1`: Victoria
- `SNOWY1`: Snowy Mountains region (deprecated)

### WEM Region

- `WEM`: Western Australia. Covering the southern half of the state on the SWIS grid.

### Region Properties

Each region contains:
- Unique timezone settings
- Price nodes
- Interconnector definitions
- Generation facilities
- Demand data

## Data Collection

### Interval Data

Networks collect data at different intervals:

- `NEM`:
  - Dispatch: 5-minute intervals
  - Price: 5-minute intervals
  - Demand: 5-minute intervals
  - Rooftop solar: 30-minute intervals

- `WEM`:
  - Dispatch: 5-minute intervals
  - Price: 5-minute intervals
  - Demand: 5-minute intervals
  - Rooftop solar: 30-minute intervals

- `APVI`:
  - Dispatch: 15-minute intervals

## Network Flows

### NEM Interconnectors

Interconnectors link different regions and allow the import and export of generation between regions:

- `NSW1-QLD1`: Queensland to NSW
- `VIC1-NSW1`: Victoria to NSW
- `VIC1-SA1`: Victoria to South Australia
- `VIC1-TAS1`: Victoria to Tasmania (Basslink)

### WEM Interconnectors

WEM is an isolated network, with no interconnections.
